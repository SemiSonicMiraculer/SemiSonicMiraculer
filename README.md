My name is Mykola. And my nickname is Semi-Sonic Miraculer, or shortly SSM. I'm 17 years old. I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Living in Poland from August 2021. Just a student, second form, programming and origami lover.

My interests includes programming, yeah. My favorite prog. langs are C/C++ and maybe Python. And my favorite game engine is Unreal Engine 5. Also I like Photoshop. When I make something unusual, I'm being happy. Then, origami. Making origami, we can implement our dream works.

Well, I'm fan of retro things. Old songs can make me dancing and dreaming. My favorite songs are by Aerosmith, Scorpions, The Beatles and other bands from 80s/90s. Retro games are inspiring me to create something cool and very entertaining. Making the retro style is one of my hobbies.
